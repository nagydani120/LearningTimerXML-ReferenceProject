											Learning Timer

This application is created by me after 3-4 months programming, the classes are not really transparent, 
there is not much comment or description, i just did fast for myself to measure the learning progress.
(i set the daily progress to 5 .hours)

The application is able to create projects, measure times spent in projects,calculate progress, get the history and the sum,
archive and unarchive projects, save and load the sessions from .xml file, so the save is local.
(first version used .txt file, i upgraded to .xml) 
 
I didn't found for Linux a normal project learning timer, so i did mine.

 (there are some smaller bugs, sometimes there is much hardcoded part, 
 but it was between my first projects what contains more classes, so in summary its working, i learned a lot)
