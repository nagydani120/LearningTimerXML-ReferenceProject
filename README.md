# LearningTimerXML

Learning Timer is mainly created for measuring the time spent on different projects.

**Features:**

-> create, delete, select a project <br>
-> archive/unarchive projects <br>
-> local save to .xml file <br>
-> start, stop, and pause the timer <br>
-> history, daily average, clear history <br>
-> change progress target, show a daily progress percentage <br>
-> gui <br>


The runnable project contains **2** files: 
- Runnable jar file that contains all necessary file
- An .xml file where everything is saved

The .xml file has been set to be near the jar file, so if there is no file located with name "ltdata.xml" then it is
going to be created automatically.



*Note: The learning time was my first "bigger" project. I choose this because I didn't find an acceptable alternative in Linux OS to 
measure the time spent with learning. The uploaded .xml file contains my time sessions(I didn't use every time)*
