# LearningTimerXML

Learning Timer is mainly created for measuring the time spent with different project.

Features:

-> create, delete, select project
-> archive/unarchive projects
-> local save to .xml file
-> start, stop, pause the timer
-> history,daily average, clear history
-> change progress target, show daily progress percentage
-> gui


The runnable project contains 2 files: 
- Runnable jar file what contains all necessary file
- An .xml file where everything is saved

The xml file has been set to be near of the jar file, so if there is no file located with name "ltdata.xml" then it is
going to be created automatically.



The learning time was my first "bigger" project. I choose this because i didn't find an acceptable alternative in Linux OS to 
measure the time spent with learning. The uploaded .xml file contains my time sessions(i didn't used every time)
